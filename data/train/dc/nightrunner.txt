Fictional character biography

Bilal Alsselah (Arabic: بلال الصلاح), a French-Algerian was raised by
his single mother on the outskirts of Paris, France. Though peaceful, on
Bilal's 16th birthday, he and his friend Aarif were caught in the middle
of a French-Muslim protest, and beaten mercilessly by the police force.
After they both healed, Aarif gave Bilal a gift including the music of
Leni Urbana, an urban representative of the Muslim people in France,
urging Bilal to listen to her words. That night Aarif was killed by
police after he set fire to their station. After hearing of his friend's
death, Bilal would forever be changed. Though he sympathized with the
protesters, he found faults on both sides and decided to take a cue from
Batman's origins: becoming a symbol, without racial or religious bias
that could make a difference for what's right and just. Already a
superior parkour and freerun athlete, he donned the mask of Nightrunner
in order to help the people's cause and bring justice to
Clichy-sous-Bois.

He assists Batman in taking down a child-slavery ring.
