Fictional character biography

Bird-Brain is one of a number of "Ani-Mates", creatures created by an
insane geneticist named the Ani-Mator, combining the characteristics of
human beings and other animals. The Ani-Mator subjected his creations to
a number of cruel and deadly experiments, but Bird-Brain escapes the
Ani-Mator's island and befriends the New Mutants. They try to acclimate
him to regular society, which fails miserably time and again, mainly
because Bird-Brain would eat all the food he saw. For the most part,
Bird-Brain is unable to communicate with the New Mutants, despite the
language powers of the New Mutant Cypher, because of how simplistic
Bird-Brain's language is. In his first conversation with Cypher,
Bird-Brain explains that he has been trained with food by starving him
and using food as a reward.

Bird-Brain develops relatively close relationships with Cypher (who is
fascinated by Bird-Brain's language) and Wolfsbane for her changeling
ability, through which he sees her as a kindred spirit, and her general
kindness to him. Feeling he had abandoned the other mutated creatures
on the island, Bird-Brain eventually returns with the New Mutants to
free them. The Ani-Mator, attempting to shoot Wolfsbane, instead
kills Cypher, and Magik exiles the Ani-Mator to the dimension of Limbo
in retaliation. Once freed from the Ani-Mator's tyranny, Bird-Brain
decides to remain on the island with the other Ani-Mates.
